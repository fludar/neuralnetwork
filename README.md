## üßÆ Key Features

- No external machine learning libraries used  
- Handles dataset loading and training (MNIST-like format)  
- Builds multiple layers dynamically  
- Training loop with accuracy testing per epoch  
- Console-based outputs for transparency and learning  



## üõ† Build Instructions

This project was developed using **Visual Studio Code** and **Java 21**.  

To build it:
1. Clone the repo ```git clone https://github.com/fludar/neuralnetwork/``` 
2. Follow this [tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/java/java-tutorial) if you don't have Java already installed
2. Run the app


## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

Example run from VS Code PowerShell terminal:

```PS E:\github\neuralnetwork>  & 'C:\Program Files\Eclipse Adoptium\jdk-21.0.4.7-hotspot\bin\java.exe' '-XX:+ShowCodeDetailsInExceptionMessages' '-cp' 'E:\github\neuralnetwork\bin' 'App'```
